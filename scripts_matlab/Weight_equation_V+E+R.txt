# Wet weight = wet/dry weight ratio * [weight of structure + weight of (reserve + repro buffer)]

Ww = ( w * (d_V * V + w_E / mu_E * (E + R)) )

State variables:
V - structure (cm^3)
E - energy in reserve (J)
R - energy in repro buffer (J)

Parameters
 - d_V, w_E and mu_E set to default DEB values
 - w set to average value for fish (ratio of 5 = 20% of dry weight)

d_V     0.2         # g/cm^3, specific density of structure (dry weight)
w_E     23.9000     ; g/mol
mu_E    550000      ; J/mol
w       5           ; wet / dry weight coefficient
